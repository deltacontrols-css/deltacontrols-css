- 👋 Hi, I’m @deltacontrols-css
- 👀 I’m interested in making GCL snippets that can be re-used.  They should by "object-independent", which means that no code is tied to specific objects.  Each program should use internal variables for all logic.  At the top, you should link the inputs, at the bottom you should link the outputs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best use github for GCL snippets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GCL snippets to build a library of "functional code blocks"
- 📫 How to reach me: deltacontrols.css@gmail.com (Control System Solutions Team) or pds@deltacontrols.com (General Help Desk)
